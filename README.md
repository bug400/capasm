Description
-----------
CAPASM is a software suite primary intended for programmers who write LEX files
for the HP-75 handheld computer. The software includes an assembler (capasm)
which is almost compatible to the assembler which is part of the HP-83/85
Assembler ROM. The MAKELEX75 utility converts the binary object file, which
is generated by the assembler into a HP-75 lex file.

CAPASM is entirely written in Python3.

Features
--------

The assembler is compatible to the HP-83/85 ROM Assembler with the following
exceptions:

* The GLO, LNK and all conditional pseudo ops are not supported and throw
  an error
* The ABS 16 and ABS 32 pseudo ops are not supported. To compile ROM code
  use ABS nnnn, where nnnn is an octal number of the base address.
* ASC and ASP only support quoted strings as arguments. A quote within a
  string must be expressed as a double quote, e.g. ""","" MISSING".
* The pseudo ops LST and UNL are silently ignored.
* The assembler provides built in symbol tables for the HP-85, HP-87 and
  HP-75. The "-m" option specifies which table to use. Default is to use
  the table for the HP-75.
* The assembler provides a symbol cross reference listing which is activated
  with the "-r 2" option.
* Line numbers in the assembler source file are optional

You can get the manual for the HP-83/85 ROM Assembler from the 
[www.series80.org](http://www.series80.org) web site.

CAPDIS is a two pass assembler which resolves all symbols in the second pass.
The HP-83/85 ROM Assembler is a single pass assembler which backpatches the
generated object file as soon as a symbol is resolved. 
This may result in a different behavior if global symbols are redefined by 
local symbols.  Unless you are programming ROM code it is highly recommended 
to use the "-c" option to treat each redefinition of global symbols as an error.

Compatibility
-------------

CAPASM should run under LINUX, Windows 10 and mac OS, if a Python Interpreter (version 3.6 and higher) is available.


Installation
------------

See the [Installation Instructions](https://github.com/bug400/capasm/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for details.

Example of Use
--------------

The "lex75" subdirectory of this repository contains the sample assembler 
source file "phyconst.asm". To create a lex file for the HP-75 type:

        capasm phyconst.asm -m 75

This assembles the source file and creates a binary object file "phyconst.bin".
If you invoke the assembler with:

       capasm phyconst.asm -m 75 -l phyconst.lst -r 2

you get a full listing with symbol cross reference in the file "pyhconst.lst".
Do not forget to specify the "-m 75" option if you assemble files for the
HP-75.

To create a lex file for the HP-75 type:

      mkelx75 phyconst.bin

this creates a lex file phyconst.lex with a proper LIF header.

For a full description of the command line parameters invoke the programs with
the "-h" option.

A special acknowledgement goes to 
[Everett Kaser](https://www.kaser.com/hp85.html).
He formerly wrote the HP-83/85 Assembler ROM software which is a heroic deed
compared to writing an assembler in Python without any constraints concerning
memory or CPU speed.

On his website you can download his HP85/HP87 emulator and a powerful disassembler (CAPDIS) for the Capricorn CPU. His  documentation 
[Understanding how the HP85 Works from the Inside](https://groups.io/g/hpseries80/wiki/1884)
and the assembler source files he disassembled from the ROM binaries 
were essential for me to get this software done.
